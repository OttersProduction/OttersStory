What is Washing/Introduction
Washing is a method of getting additional MaxHP in Royals (and many other oldschool servers) witout losing damage, based on adding AP to int, using that to generate MP, and turning MP into HP. It's done since many bosses deal very high damage, which would leave some classes entirely unable to survive naturally. However, it tends to be expensive and poorly understood, which can increase total washing costs and frustrate or confuse players.

The goal of this guide is to explain the basic concepts behind washing - very little of the actual numbers will be included here, but instead the mechanics behind how it all works are explained. Feel free to ask questions and I'll answer to the best of my ability. However, just asking "how do I wash to X HP" or "is my character ruined" questions will be ignored - read the guide and decide for yourself.

Do I Need to Wash? (featuring alternative methods and HP goals)
Generally, washing is not strictly required. The only class that would be forced to wash is Bishop (and other mages, although they're generally not invited to high level bosses so it doesn't matter as much), although other classes may choose to wash to skip the grind. I personally tend to do a mix of washing and questing for my HP, but the exact balance is all up to personal preference.

Zanck's Bossing Guide is a useful resource that'll tell you the max damage each boss does, among other things. You can use this as a reference to determine an HP goal - the total HP you want to have at a given level, in order to do all the bosses you want. If you'd rather skip reading the lengthy guide and making decisions without even knowing what bosses you might do, here's my recommendations, going from easiest to hardest:
10k HP by level 155 - Enough to run Horntail
12k HP by level 145 - Enough to run Shao, which is a high-exp daily boss. (Note - if it's your first character, you likely will not be geared enough to run Shao at lv 145. Shao takes a high DPS check)
17.5k HP by level 175 - Enough to run Auf Haven and Von Leon
There's a few caveats to HP goals:
Bishops (and other mages) need less due to Magic Guard. I recommend 5-10k HP on bishops if you want to run Horntail or Von Leon, and however much MP you'd like.
Shadowers need less due to Meso Guard. However, extra HP is always useful as shadowers are often chosen as the "seduce" target for Horntail. I won't get into details here except they may take extra damage if so.
Dark Knights want 30k HP for their Berserk skill, which gives extra damage. They get Hyper Body, which increases HP by 60%, meaning they only need 18,750 without Hyper Body, although more may be helpful to not need to recast HB.
Paladins and Heroes can go slightly lower - Power Guard and Achilles are skills they have to reduce damage taken. However, they have such high natural HP that it really doesn't matter - you'll have enough
An HP goal is achieved by a combination of three things:
Your natural HP at that level
Your HP gained from washing
Your HP gained from equips + quests
Natural HP tends to be in the range of 5k (ranged) - 10-12k (melee) by lv 145. However, don't worry about this too much - the washing calculator will know what it is. HP gained from washing is, well, however much more HP you need to hit your washing goal. Use the calculator and put in however much you want to wash to, and it'll calculate that. HP gained from equips and quests is somewhat self-explanatory. See Dave's post for all the sources. This can reasonably give almost 4000 extra HP, along with an additional 1k HP/month!

Generally, I wouldn't recommend washing your first character, as it tends to be expensive and your mesos would be better spent elsewhere.

Terminology
This may not be universal, but this is what things mean in my guide at least. I'll try to italicize any specific terminology I use throughout the guide
Fresh AP: An unspent Ability Point, gained from leveling up or job advancing.
Washing: Either the entire process of washing described in this guide, or HP washing
HP Washing: The process of turning excess mana into health
MP Washing: The process of turning fresh AP into excess mana
Double Washing: See MP Washing. This is an old name for it
Infinite Washing: A method of gaining extra HP/MP even without having levels or fresh AP left. Only available on some classes
HP Goal: A combination of HP and level - your goal is to have at least that much HP at that level.
Washing Goal: The amount of your HP goal that will be covered by base HP and washing. This is what you'd input to the calculator. Calculate it by subtracting the HP you plan to gain from questing/gear from your HP goal
Basics
The basic concepts behind washing all boil down to this: Nexon is bad at programming. Things might get weird, and you might wonder who ever thought that was a good idea. So, refer to the previous: Nexon is bad at programming.

Oh, also before we begin, remember this: AP resets lie. The HP/MP they show you have is your true HP/MP (before gear/buffs), but any predicted changes they show tend to be wildly incorrect, so just ignore that and go by the values your stats actually change by.

---

When you begin the game, you start with 4 points in each stat. It's impossible to go below 4 points in a stat - the game just won't let you AP reset out. But as soon as you add an AP to a stat, suddenly you can remove a point with an APR. And once you APR it down to 4 points, you can no longer remove. This system tends to be fairly intuitive for the 4 usual stats - Str, Dex, Int, and Luk. However, there's a 5th stat you can assign an AP to: HPMP. I call it that because no matter if you assign the AP to HP or to MP, it goes into the same stat pool, and can then be taken out of either HP or MP. This is the core of HP washing - conversion of extra MP into HP. It works like this:
Start with a point in HPMP
Since you have a point in HPMP, you can take a point out of HPMP with an AP reset. Taking it out of MP will remove the point from your HPMP stat, while reducing your MP
Add that point to HP, which increases your HP and adding the point back to your HPMP stat.
And now you end with a point in HPMP, except you have higher HP and lower MP. This means you can go and repeat this process as much as you want, cycling the same AP out of MP and into HP over and over
This strange combined pool, where putting a point into HP allows you to take the same exact point out of MP, is what makes washing possible.

Note that there's also something called minimum MP - an MP value that if you're below it, you can't take a point out of MP, even if you have AP in the HPMP stat. There's calculators to find it, but you can also tell that you've hit minimum MP if you have a point in HPMP and using an AP reset - if it doesn't allow you to take out of MP, but allows you to take out of HP, you've hit minimum MP.

Different classes have different washing costs partially because of different natural HP, but also because there's different MP -> HP exchange rates. Warriors get very favorable rates, while ranged classes... ouch. And mages get the worst of all.

The only issue left is: how do we get enough MP? After all, to gain thousands of HP from washing, surely that'll take thousands of MP, and who has that to spare?

MAGES! Mages have all the MP in the world, and it's not just due to their class. It's due to all the int they add. The more int you have, the more MP you gain on leveling up. It's that simple. And yes, all sources of int count for this - base int, int from MW, and int from gear. It's total int that matters here, which is why some leech buyers are picky about needing MW20 (spoilers: it's really not that big of a deal, worth <10m/hr if you actually math it out).

All one needs to do is add tons of base int, wear int gear, and level with the MW20 buff (if possible), and you'll have plenty of extra MP to turn into HP. Every 10 int (rounded down, so 50 int is the same as 55 int) gives you an extra MP each level.

This is actually where a significant portion of the cost comes from - some people add 300+ base int, and since it's nice to have damage eventually, non-mages will eventually need to turn all of that int back into their mainstat, at the cost of 1 AP Reset for every int they added.

MP Washing ("Double" washing)
This is a step of washing that's actually entirely skippable. You can wash to pretty much whatever you want without doing it. This really is just a way to lower costs, by spending 1 AP reset (and using 1 fresh AP) to save more than 1, by allowing you to add less base int and still get the MP you need.

Here's what an MP wash is:
Add 1 fresh AP to MP
Use an AP reset to remove that AP from MP, and add it somewhere else (probably your mainstat, but it's really up to you)
... that's it. And if you're thinking "wouldn't removing it just undo adding it in the first place, resulting in nothing happening?" then you clearly haven't internalized my main point last section: Nexon is bad at programming. And it turns out that adding fresh AP is different than adding with AP resets is different than removing with AP resets. Three different actions, three different formulas. MP washing is just exploiting the difference between the formula for adding fresh AP and the formula for removing AP, which happens to be approximately base int/10 (rounded down) MP per MP wash. So the more base int you have, the more MP you profit! Note that this only looks at base int - it ignores gear and Maple Warrior.

This allows you to reduce costs because at some point, you have so much base int that a single MP wash will net you huge amounts of MP, which otherwise would take adding more than 1 additional int to gain. But again, if you really don't care about wasting some meso, feel free to skip this step.

Exactly how much base int to use and how much to MP wash is a personal choice based off your HP Goal and total int gear. I recommend using the washing calculator to determine it.

Thief Weirdness
Thieves wash differently than other classes. Remember last section where I said that there's 3 different formulas for HP (and MP) changes? Well, there's 2 ways to add HP: fresh AP, or through a reset. And it turns out for thieves, adding fresh AP to HP gives you more HP than using a reset. All other classes gain more (or equal) HP through using a reset, so make sure to not trust thieves telling you to add all your AP directly to HP on your bishop!

So for thieves, instead of recycling the same AP by repeatedly removing from MP and adding to HP, they instead add a fresh AP to HP, and remove it from MP while adding to luk (or whatever, feel free to add to whatever you want). They can still wash normally like everyone else, it's just a bit less efficient, and usually you have plenty of fresh AP to use for this.

SP Reset Weirdness
Please see my Washing for Mages thread, infinite washing section. This also applies to warriors and buccaneers with their Improved MaxHP increase skill, although they really shouldn't need it with high natural HP and the existence of HP quests. The basic gist is that improved MaxHP/MP increase applies to reset ap, both adding and removing. This lets you SP reset the skill to 0 when removing, and to 10 when adding to create a difference in the HP or MP gained and los

### Washing for Mages thread

Do I need to wash? What should I wash to?
Ultimately, mages who want to participate in endgame content should wash some. I recommend having 5-10k total HP for Horntail (depending how lazy you want to be with magic guard), 8.5-9k HP for Von Leon, and I'm actually not sure for Auf since I was 15k+ when I started running.
If you're NOT interested in running HT (as a seller, buyers can go with ~2.5k), VL, or Auf, HP washing is entirely unnecessary, although mp washing can be helpful to reduce potion usage while keeping mana at safe levels for MG. Keep in mind that Fire/Poison and Ice/Lightning mages don't get invited to these bosses, leaving HP washing mostly done by Bishops.

MP is very much worth it to get to 30k; it's just nice to have MP and the extra cost isn't too high.

Anything past 10k HP I don't think is worth it. While I personally did get 30k HP 30k MP, the cost for that is extremely expensive and most players would be better off investing in gear instead of extra HP that doesn't really do anything.

Non-washing HP Sources:
There's a few other ways you can get HP without washing! Since you're a mage, each HP is much more impactful due to Magic Guard.
Ellinia HP Quest: 250 HP, 1 set ~180m
Legendary Collector OR Quest Virtuoso Medal: 1000 HP or 300 HP
Black Belt: 500 HP
Pet Equips: 200/pet is reasonable, and you can have 3 pets, for 600 total
Valentine's Day Ring: It's not BiS for mages but still quite strong, and gives 150 HP
These total up to 2.5k HP, or 167 APRs (+ a few extra to get more MP)! That's significant savings.

Sadly, Olaf's Adventurer assignment gives mages MP instead of HP, and Reuel's Elixir of Life HP quest (daily hp quest) is not available for mages.

General Washing
Washing mages, like all classes, generally happens in 2 stages. If you run out of MP, you can just restart at stage 1 though, unlike other classes who reset their base int!
I recommend starting washing no earlier than level 130, as this gives you lots of base int for good gains, and by this time you should be able to sell leech to fund your washing. If you have specific goals such as capping yourself at a low level or want 30/30, you might need to start washing earlier.

Stage 1: Get a lot of MP
MP is very easy to get for mages - our main stat is int, meaning we naturally get a lot of extra MP on leveling up, and we also have this neat skill to get even more MP:
upload_2023-6-12_14-55-39.png
However, mages generally need a lot more MP than other classes, having the worst washing ratio of any class (+15 HP for -20 MP - the only class where you get less HP gained than MP lost).

Since leveling alone won't provide you with enough MP, there's 2 ways to get extra, both using fresh AP from leveling up:

Option 1:
Regular MP washing. When you level up, put all 5 AP into MP, then immediately use 5 AP resets to -MP +int. This option is good if you're still low level and trying to hit new TMA breakpoints.

Option 2:
Delayed MP washing. This method is slightly more expensive per MP, but has a couple advantages:
If you're going to be HP washing anyways, doing a delayed wash before is free (the extra cost of SP resets for the delayed wash would be paid anyways when HP washing)
It gets you more MP per level, so if you don't have enough level ups to meet your goals, it'll reduce the amount of infinite washing you need to do. And infinite washing is extremely expensive.
When you level up, put all 5 AP into MP, and keep it there. Keep leveling and adding AP to MP until you've put 10 levels (50 AP) in. Note: the optimal amount is actually 11-12 levels, but 10 isn't too far off and makes remembering much easier.

After you've added all 50 AP to MP, use 10x 1st Job SP Resets to set Improved MaxMP Increase to 0. Then, use 50 AP Resets to -MP +Int. Finally, use another 10x 1st Job SP Resets to bring MaxMP Increase back to 10.

Since you've set MaxMP increase to 0 when removing MP, you're gaining an extra 10 MP per APR used, or 500 MP per 10 levels extra.

Note: 10 levels of MP added can give as much as 7.5k MP. Make sure you lower your MP enough to not hit 30k MP when doing this, as any MP that would be gained after 30k is wasted.

Stage 2: Turn MP into HP
Once you have enough MP, it's time to turn it into HP. If anyone tells you to add AP directly to HP you can ignore any advice they ever give you about washing again: Adding fresh AP to HP gives you ~8 HP, while resetting AP gives you 15 average.

When washing into HP, make sure Improved MaxMP Increase is reset to level 0:
upload_2023-6-12_15-8-26.png
I'd recommend doing this during a delayed wash - after resetting MaxMP increase, use 49 APRs to -MP +int, then wash to HP, then use 1 final APR to -MP +int again.

Once it's level 0, all you need to do is use a ton of APRs doing -MP +HP. Keep in mind this requires having at least 1 AP in HP/MP. If both arrows are grayed out in the AP Reset like this, that means you have 0 points in HP/MP, and need to either put a fresh AP into MP or AP reset from int/luk into HP
upload_2023-6-12_15-10-53.png

Each APR removes 20 MP (30 if you didn't set MaxMP increase to 0, which makes it significantly more expensive) and gives 10-20 (15 average) HP. Keep using APRs until you hit your target HP goal or get too low on MP. I personally like to stay above 20k MP, so as soon as I get down to that I stop washing.

Remember to set Improved MaxMP Increase back to 10 after finishing!

Infinite Washing
Level 200 and sad that you missed your chance to wash? Want to wash further than what your remaining fresh AP you'll earn allows? Time to abuse this MaxMP increase skill even more than we already have been!

Infinite washing is a way of using Improved MaxMP Increase (1st job skill) to gain more HP and MP, without leveling. All it takes is ridiculous amounts of APRs - 1 apr gives ~7.8 MP.

Step 0:
Make sure you have at least 1 AP in HP or MP. If you don't, and don't have fresh AP, use an AP reset to -int (or luk) and +HP.

Step 1:
Reset MaxMP Increase to 0 using 10 1st job SP Resets

Step 2:
Use AP Resets to -MP +HP. Each APR will remove 20 MP and give 15 HP. Keep using them until you're close to 30k HP, or hit the lowest you're willing to have your MP go (for me, that's 20k MP)

Step 3:
Reset MaxMP Increase back to 10 using 10 1st job SP Resets

Step 4:
Use AP Resets to -HP +MP. Each APR will remove 10 HP and give 29 MP. Keep using them until you're close to 30k MP, or hit the lowest you're willing to have your HP go.

Step 5:
If you want more HP/MP, go to Step 1

Step 6:
Use 1 final AP reset and -MP (or HP) to get that int/luk back.

Estimated Costs
Since AP resets give you 15 HP for ever 20 MP lost, 1 HP = 20/15 = = 1.333... MP.

In total, ignoring 1st job SP reset cost as that's relatively minor compared to the rest, you use 2 AP resets (-MP +HP and -HP +MP) to gain 5 HP and 9 MP. 5 HP \* 1.33... MP/HP = 6.66... MP, or 2 APRs = 15.66... MP, meaning 1 APR gains you 7.833... MP. You can use this, along with your current HP/MP from your goal, to estimate how much more you need to wash
